What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates a folder for the metadata.
You then need to create the first commit for your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the
repository. It allows you to choose which files from the working directory
should be saved to the repository and let's you double check if the files
are correct before adding them to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

You can use this area to see which files will be commited to the repository. If
you have more than one logical change, remove the files from the staging area 
that are not part of the first logical change. You can always add those to the
repository in a later commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

If you have a final product but want to add a new feature that could break
the final product. Branches would help because you can build upon the old
final version without touching it.
