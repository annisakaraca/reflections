When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When you are working on multiple machines or when you are collaborating with
others.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are in the middle of creating something, having changes automatically
pulled could overwrite those changes.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are clones made on GitHub's servers from another GitHub repo. A clone
is a copy of a repository on GitHub to your local machine. Branches are 
various working states of a repository. Forks are used when you want to build
upon a project created by someone else. Clones are used when you want to get
something from GitHub onto your computer. Branches are used when you want to
develop a new feature without breaking your production code.
