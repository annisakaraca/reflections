When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When you are working on multiple machines or when you are collaborating with
others.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are in the middle of creating something, having changes automatically
pulled could overwrite those changes.
